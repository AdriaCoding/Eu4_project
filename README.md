# Eu4_project

Simple code that analyses what idea groups each country can take for version 1.32

The aim is to find the best vassals for a One Faith - One Culture run, so we need vassals taking religious ideas.
We are only interested in the Adm category of Ideas. Innovative and Expansion have very low weights or are situational,
and except for QaraQoyunlu, no country can take both Religious and Humanist.
That means that the most present Adm idea groups are Religious (73.2%), Administrative (38.6%), and Economic (92.1%).

You can edit the code in line 55 to get the countries with the combination of ideas you'd like. In my case, i was 
interested in countries withouts Economic but with Religious and Administrative ideas.
